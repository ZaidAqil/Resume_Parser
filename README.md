# Resume_Parser
Extract info from a text resume
A resume parser using Python, NER (Named Entity Recognition) model, and Power BI for visualization is a tool designed to extract relevant information from resumes, such as names, contact details, skills, education, work experience, and more, and then visualize this data using Power BI. Here's a simplified overview of how this system works:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Users submit resumes in various formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX, etc.).
   - Python libraries like `PyPDF2` or `docx2txt` can be used to extract text from these documents.

2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - The extracted text is preprocessed to remove unnecessary formatting, special characters, and other noise.

3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:
   - A Named Entity Recognition model, like spaCy or NLTK, is used to identify and extract specific entities from the text. These entities could include names, email addresses, phone numbers, skills, education details, and work experience.

4. **Data Extraction**:
   - The NER model identifies and extracts relevant information from the resume text. For example, it identifies names, contact information, job titles, and dates of employment.

5. **Data Storage**:
   - Extracted data is stored in a structured format, such as a CSV or database, for easy retrieval and analysis.

6. **Data Visualization with Power BI**:
   - Power BI is a powerful data visualization tool that connects to your data source, allowing you to import and transform the extracted data.
   - Create interactive dashboards and reports that provide insights into the parsed resumes. You can use various charts and visuals to represent information like skills distribution, education levels, work experience timelines, and more.
   - Power BI can be configured to refresh the data automatically whenever new resumes are parsed.

7. **User Interface**:
   - Develop a user-friendly interface, which could be a web application or a desktop application, that allows users to submit resumes, view parsed data, and access Power BI dashboards.

8. **Automation**:
   - Implement automation to periodically parse new resumes, update the database, and refresh Power BI reports.

9. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the system to a server or cloud platform for accessibility to users.

10. **Feedback and Improvement**:
    - Collect feedback from users and continuously improve the NER model and the Power BI dashboards for better accuracy and insights.

This simplified description outlines the core components of a resume parser system that uses Python, NER for data extraction, and Power BI for data visualization. The actual implementation may involve more complexity and customization based on your specific requirements.
